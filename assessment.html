    <p style="font-size: xx-large;"><strong>Re: Eileen Dover University application</strong></p><br>
    <p style="font-size: x-large;">Dear Eileen.</p><br>
    <p style="font-size: large;">Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part
    of your PHD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections</p><br>
    <p style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>Starting Dates</strong></p><br>
    <p style="font-size: large;">We are happy to accomodate you Starting your study with us any time, however it would suit us better if you 
    could start at the beginning of the semester; the start dates for each ones are as follows: </p><br>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-size: large;">First Semester: 9 September 2016</li><br>
        <li style="font-size: large;">Second Semester: 15 January 2017</li><br>
        <li style="font-size: large;">Third Semester: 2 May 2017</li><br>
    </ul><br>
    <p style="font-size: large;">Please let me know if this is OK, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p><br>
    <p style="font-size: large;">You can find more information about <u style="color:aqua;">important university dates</u> on our website</p>
    <p style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>Subjects of Study</strong></p><br>
    <p style="font-size: large;">At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility---as long as the subjects fall
    somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just
    the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued 
    by are as follows, in order of priority:</p><br>

    <ol style="font-size: large;">
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the heath benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li><br>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>0</sup>C (86<sup>0</sup>F), when the audience
        size exponentially increases (effect of 3 * 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li><br>
        <li><u>HTML </u>and <u>CSS</u> constructs for representing musical scores</li><br>
    </ol>
    <p style="font-size: large;">So Please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take,
    required staff and other resources, and anything else we'd need to know? Thanks.</p><br>
    <p style="font-size: x-large;">Exotic Dance Moves</p><br>
    <p style="font-size: large;">Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answes your question,
    my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p><br>
    <dl style="font-size: large;">
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
        <dd>A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300<u>BC</u>, a whole village would dance around in a circle
        like chickens to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".</dd>
        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a mean of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved
            huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in impreceptably tiny, very
            rapid movements, One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
         <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
         <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explores in the 1960s believed to have discoverd 
             a new dance style characterised by "robotic" , stilted movements, being practiced byinhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada.
             Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.
         </dd>
    </dl><br>

    <p style="font-size: large;">Yours sincerely,</p><br>
